# This script removes a phone from CUCM
# This script will only remove the phone, it will not remove the line, EM profile, RDP, User, etc.  

# As with ANY remove script, USE IT WITH CAUTION
# APIs are powerful and a typo can mean removing one thing or a LOT of things
# Always, if you can test your scripts in a DEV.  I recommend using Cisco's DevNET Sandboxes which you can find in the readme file of this repo
